## Architecture Design

### Package and Class diagram

[UML here]

### State Machine of game

### Design Patterns used

* Singleton for LevelAssetManager class. This class uses the LIBGDX AssetManager class which is unique for all the levels that use it, and since the game does a lot of loading and unloading of levels a single universal acess point for the asset manager is useful, to load the correct assets for each level and to get those assets to be able to draw them and play them.
* Observer for all classes in Input package. These classes extend the InputAdapter class from LIBGDX which implements this Pattern. It's used to notify Screen objects (such as GameScreen) when user input happens (touch, gyroscope) and to transmit it.
* Factory in MyGame class. In this class there are methods to create specific levels (GameWorld instances) and giving them to GameLevel class to be manipulated.
* State in LevelDirector. Different enemies for GameWorld class are generated based on this class's internal state (time since game start, numbers of present enemies, user input statistics which should "user stress", etc).
* State in GameLevel. This class usually updates GameWorld which is attached to it and draws the objects present in it, but if the hero dies it shouldn't this anymore and the screen should be changeed to show a menu.
* GameLoop is used in GameScreen. This class extends Screen which implements this. A method is called peridically to uipdate the game state (update game World, draws objects) and it receives input to control the game World state.

## Test Design

This project uses an external library (LIBGDX) to make mobile application development easier, therefore this project is divided into 2 main parts to allow for unit testing: 
* (Input and LIBGDXwrapper packages) Graphics and other library related stuff (camera, input, asset management, etc)
* (gameLogic package) Game Logic where all the objects such as the user character, enemies, platforms, etc are represented and interact.

Unit test are only really applicable to the 2nd part, so all of the objects in gameLogic package should be tested.

* Character class will be tested for correct movement and position, to ascertain that it moves correctly.
* GameWorld will be tested for character collisions, to see if the hero can destroy enemies (by jumping on them) and if the hero can be killed (and the GameWorld correctly sets the game as lost)
* LevelDirector class will be tested to see if it correctly generates enemies for GameWorld, with the appropriate difficulty given a time and user input and world statistics
* Hero Lamp will be tested to see if it generates light apporpriatly given some hero actions
* Also any other objects in this package that we might need would be tested appropriately.
